<p style="color: midnight">My first class at Emobilis was interesting.
  We were given a tour of the school then a brief of what was expected of us. This was all done by our lecturer.
  We then confirmed that our computers were working then we downloaded some software which we would use during
  our lessons. So far am glad I school at Emobilis.</p>
